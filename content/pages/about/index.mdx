Hi ðŸ‘‹!

This is Shubham (He/Him).

I am a Full time software engineer, currently working as a SDE [@NEETPrep](https://neetprep.com) an edTech startup. 

My hobbies are mostly anything software related, let it be building, breaking, reviewing or just researching about it.
I have worked across multiple tech stacks be it for web development, pen testing, dev ops etc.

I like to try out new pieces of tech and softwares, to get a new outlook on software philosophy, design 
patterns & overall to become a better engineer. I believe like everything writing good software is both a 
craft (mathematical and algorithmic part) & art (creative, more expressive & elegant part), and itâ€™s important to strike a good balance between 
both.

Thanks for reading so far. 

In case you would like to talk with me (let it be for career or writing opportunity or just want to talk) you 
can mail me at [shubham1.singh15@gmail.com](mailto:shubham1.singh15@gmail.com). <Skill/>
