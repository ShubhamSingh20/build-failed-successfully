In this short write up, I will try to introduce some very basic functional programming (fp) concepts which will help you in writing more cleaner, simple, readable and easy to maintain code.

I am using python for this write up but the points that I am about to mention are language independent, these features will be available in most of the dynamic or static languages and if not they can be implemented from scratch as well.

For examples I would write a piece of code in imperative style first and then write the fp alternative to it.

### 1. Maps
**template**: *map(f(x) -> x', Iterable) -> Iterable*

Mapping is used whenever you have something that can be iterated  over and we want a one to one mapping for that iterate. Meaning for every element in that iterable we would like to get a new element. 

```python
# make each integer element multiple of 10
buff = []
collection = [1,2,3,4]

for num in collection:
    buff.append(num*10)
```
I have seen above code or a template similar to that more times than I count. Basically we have a collection or list of data and we declare a new list in which we append elements after performing some operations from a initial iteratable object.

Since, we need a new element for every existing element in the list we can simply use a map function.

```python
buff = list(map(lambda x: x*10, collection))
```

### 2. Filter
**template**: *filter(f(x) -> bool, Iterable) -> Iterable*

Again, we have a collection and we some conditional logic to determine which element should make into the final list.

```python
# Get All the strings with length more than 4
collection = ["js", "python", "haskell", "erlang", "c++", "ruby"]
buff = []

for prog in collection:
    if len(prog) > 4:
        buff.append(prog)
```

Using filter it can be simply return as: 

```python
buff = list(filter(lambda prog: bool(len(prog) > 4), collection))
```

## 3. Reduce

**template**: *reduce(f(accumulator, x) -> x', Iterable, initalState) -> accumulator*

Reduce takes in 3 main arguments a collection or input iterable over which it can iterate, a function for reduction and an initial state for an accumulator, which is used to hold the result of the previous computations and in the end it return backs the accumulator.  

```python
# for a given string, uppercase all the vowel letters
collection = "this is lower string"
out = ""

for c in collection:
  if c in ['a', 'i', 'e', 'o', 'u']:
    out += c.upper()
  else:
    out += c

#output: "thIs Is lOwEr strIng"
```

Using reduce we can further boil down the imperative style

```python
from functools import reduce

def vowelToUpper(acc : str, c: str):
  if c in ['a', 'i', 'e', 'o', 'u']:
    return acc + c.upper()
  return acc + c

# initialState for accumulator is an empty string ("")
out = reduce(vowelToUpper, collection, "")

#output: "thIs Is lOwEr strIng"
```
### Note

Try to use the above specified functions alongside each other for writing more readable code.

Let's take an example: 

```python
# Let's say we have a class N (node), consiting of type & amount
# And we need to return sum of all the nodes of given type "X"

from functools import reduce

class N:
    def __init__(self, e, amount) -> None:
        self.e_type = e
        self.amount = amount

# here we have a collection of nodes consisting of 
# type which can be 'A', 'B' or 'C'
col = [N('A', 20), N('B', 10), N('B', 70), N('C', 72), N('A', 29)]

def get_type_count(node_type: str, collection : list):
	# pass the output of filter as input to reduce
	# we can pass filter directly as well directly as well.
    filtered_collection = filter(lambda x: x.e_type == node_type, col)
    return reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x.amount, filtered_collection, 0)

final = get_type_count('A', col)
print(final)

#output
# 42
```
