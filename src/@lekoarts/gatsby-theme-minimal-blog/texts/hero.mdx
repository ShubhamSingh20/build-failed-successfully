Hi 👋!

This is Shubham (He/Him).

I am a Full time software engineer, currently working as a SDE [@NEETPrep](https://neetprep.com) an edTech startup. 

My hobbies are mostly anything software related, let it be building, breaking, reviewing or just researching about it.
I have worked across multiple tech stacks be it for web development, pen testing, dev ops etc.

I like to try out new pieces of tech and softwares, to get a new outlook on software philosophy, design 
patterns & overall to become a better engineer. I believe like everything writing good software is both a 
craft (mathematical and algorithmic part) & art (creative, more expressive & elegant part), and it’s important to strike a good balance between 
both.
